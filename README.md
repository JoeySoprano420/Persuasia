# Persuasia Language Documentation

## Overview

**Persuasia** is a persuasive programming language designed to structure, deliver, and interpret arguments in a format meant to influence, inspire, negotiate, or emotionally appeal. Its syntax is grounded in rhetorical devices, ethical positioning, and emotion-aware logic.

Persuasia is used in:

* Dialogue engines
* Narrative decision systems
* AI simulacra negotiation
* Ethical argumentation models
* Interactive fiction

File extension: `.ppl`

## Language Paradigm

**Rhetorical-Instructional**

* Logic-driven, emotionally-weighted.
* Argument-first, outcome-oriented.
* Narrative as code.

---

## Core Syntax

### `claim "..."`

The central argument or thesis.

```ppl
claim "We must abandon automated surveillance systems."
```

### `support "..."`

Evidence, facts, or moral justification.

```ppl
support "They violate fundamental rights to privacy."
```

### `appeal [ethos|pathos|logos]: "..."`

Rhetorical appeal type:

* `ethos`: credibility
* `pathos`: emotion
* `logos`: logic

```ppl
appeal pathos: "Imagine your child's every move recorded by strangers."
```

### `counter "..."`

Anticipated objection.

```ppl
counter "But what about national security?"
```

### `reframe "..."`

Redefine the opposition’s argument in your favor.

```ppl
reframe "True security protects both liberty and safety."
```

### `action "..."`

Call to action or proposed outcome.

```ppl
action "Replace invasive systems with transparent alternatives."
```

### `conclude "..."`

Final summary line with persuasive force.

```ppl
conclude "Let us lead with values, not with fear."
```

### `iffelt emotion:`

Conditional block triggered by reader/listener’s emotional state.

```ppl
iffelt anxious:
    support "The illusion of safety is not worth the loss of dignity."
}
```

### `reflect "..."`

Ask the reader to introspect or consider morally.

```ppl
reflect "If your freedom was traded for a fleeting sense of safety, would you still call it freedom?"
```

## Emotional Context Triggers

Recognized emotions include:

* `anxious`
* `angry`
* `hopeful`
* `ashamed`
* `inspired`
* `desperate`

These are used with `iffelt` to deliver conditional logic based on emotional resonance.

Interpreter that executes `.ppl` scripts and displays the logical + emotional structure.

* CLI: `python persuasia_runner.py file.ppl`
* GUI: `python persuasia_runner.py --gui`

### 2. **PersuasiaApp.exe / Persuasia.pkg**

Compiled desktop version with:

* Drag-and-drop `.ppl` file interpreter
* Real-time rhetorical analysis
* Highlighted appeals/counters

### 3. **NSIS / DMG Installers**

Installer packages that place the app into system locations with:

* Icon integration
* Splash branding
* Desktop shortcuts

### 4. **.ppl Templates**

Ready-to-edit rhetorical scripts:

```ppl
